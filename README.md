# R-scripts used in the paper SNP genotyping revealed a hybrid zone between Mytilus chilensis and M. platensis in southern South America (the Strait of Magellan, Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, and the Falkland Islands)

The following script in R where used to perform the following analysis or to plot different results:

Assignment.r: Used to generate tables for species/hybrid identification with the probabilities/scores resulting from each method.

DAPC.r: DAPC analysis with the Adegenet package.

Map.r: Generate a map with the different sampling locations and also add geographic landforms or specific points.

Map_with_PieCharts.r: Generate a map with the different sampling locations with geographic landforms or specific points. Also, incorporate Pie Charts with the assignment to species/hybrid in each sampling location. 

plotlikestructure.r: Plot the obtained scores/probabilities for assignation from different methods as a STRUCTURE plot.
